# SOM-Self-Organization-Map-Model
This code builds a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised deep learning model, to detect potential credit card fraud. After preprocessing and scaling the data, it maps customers onto a 10x10 grid. Outliers—possible frauds—are detected via high MID (mean inter-neuron distance) and visualized.
